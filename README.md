This is a collection of codes developed during the academic course on remote sensing by Prof. Rocchini Duccio, UniBo.
The codes provide useful tools for everyone who faces remote sensing and image analysis for the first time. The comments briefely explain each function and/or provide an insight on the topic.
Each file developes a single topic, providing general informations and practical applications of the theory.
Some codes focus on tools strictly used for image analysis, others combine that knowledge with ecological notions to create functioning algorithms that can be used for actual analyses
